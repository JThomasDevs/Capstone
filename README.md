# Computer Science Capstone Project

For my Capstone project, I was tasked with improving artifacts from previous Computer Science courses, specifically in the areas of:
- Software engineering and design
- Data structures and algorithms
- Databases

For the areas of software engineering/design and databases, I have chosen to improve my artifact from IT-145, one of my earliest CS courses. 
This artifact was a simple exercise in creating classes and using inheritance to create "is a" relationships between some of the classes.
This artifact will be enhanced in the areas of software engineering/design and databases through the addition of a user-friendly GUI and later, a database to hold data across sessions.

For the area of data structures and algorithms, I have chosen to improve my artifact from CS-260 (CS-300 when I was enrolled), my DSA course.
This artifact involved implementing a Binary Search Tree to efficiently store course and prerequisite information in memory. 
I will enhance this artifact by converting the BST to an AVL tree, a form of self-balancing BST that uses rotations and modified insertion/deletion logic to maintain balance as more data is added to the tree.

The original location for my CS-260(CS-300) artifact is [here](https://github.com/JThomasDevs/SNHU-Portfolio/tree/main/CS-300%20Portfolio%20Submission).
